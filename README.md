# Password-Generator
This is a class challenge, in which I was assigned to execute a password generator using a starter code and the window object.
## Description
In this project I wanted to practice coding an interactive interface with JavaScript with the goal of generating a random password that includes the options of four different types of characters (upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols.) With a given starter code, I first started coding the window prompts providing the criteria and parameters for generating the password. Based on the user's choices of included characters, I created code that would randomly pick samples of those. These were then placed in an array, which then undergoes a loop to pick a number of random characters matching the user's chosen password length. The final step is the return and display of the random password.    

## User Story


AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
